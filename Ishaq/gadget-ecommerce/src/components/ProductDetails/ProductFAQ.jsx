If you Google dual Sim for Apple products you will find that it goes all the way back to iPhone AX or AR. iPhone X is not compatible with dual Sim technology. It is listed on Appleâ€˜s website and you can have two different providers. If you go under the general settings and the about you will see that there is a Sim and then an eSIM. Hopefully this helps you."
